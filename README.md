# Check Your Privilege
Check Your Privilege is a simple React Native mobile application that allows users to split their tab based on "privilege" rather than an even split. The amount of "privilege" is calculated based on what they are paid in comparison to a white man in the United States of America. Using the report by PayScale (https://www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap) the app will calculate how much of the bill you should pay, to "even the playing field" and have the most privileged patron pay more as a sort of reparation. The credit for this application goes to Colorado Comedian Hannah Jones, who has this idea for an app as part of her stand up routine. This app was made while self teaching myself React Native.
